Enforce security baselines in AWS organizations using AWS Control Tower, SCPs (Service Control Policies), and governance controls for centralized compliance.
Lab 21: Security Baseline Enforcement with AWS Control Tower & SCPs
1. Lab Title
Security Baseline Enforcement with AWS Control Tower & SCPs
2. Aim
To implement AWS Control Tower with Service Control Policies (SCPs) for centralized governance and security baseline enforcement across AWS accounts.
3. Scope
This lab demonstrates the creation of a secure AWS landing zone using AWS Control Tower. It includes steps for setting up SCPs, managing organizational units, and enforcing compliance.
4. Tools & Technologies Used
- AWS Control Tower
- AWS Organizations
- IAM & SCPs
- CloudShell & Console
- GitHub for Documentation
5. Procedure
Step 1: Navigate to AWS Control Tower from the AWS Management Console
Step 2: Attempt to launch AWS Control Tower setup wizard
Step 3: Create organizational units (OUs)
Step 4: Configure account factory settings (IAM roles, naming)
Step 5: Enable mandatory controls and guardrails (e.g., preventive, detective)
Step 6: Review error (activation failed due to pending account issue)
Step 7: Troubleshoot and attempt retry; monitor via Control Tower Dashboard
Step 8: Evaluate account structure, OU creation, and permission policies
Step 9: Review SCP enforcement settings and guardrails
Step 10: Document setup, limitations, and pending actions
6. Achievements
- Demonstrated the structure of AWS Control Tower landing zone
- Simulated multi-account governance framework with SCP
- Identified billing/account issues affecting Control Tower setup
- Documented key steps for organizational security governance
7. Significance
This lab is crucial for organizations adopting a multi-account AWS environment, allowing automated setup of compliance controls and account governance. It improves visibility, audit readiness, and security posture.
8. Limitations
- Control Tower setup failed due to incomplete account activation
- Unable to apply full SCP due to Control Tower failure
- Costs incurred due to unused resources must be managed
9. Lessons Learned
- Ensure billing/account setup is complete before launching Control Tower
- SCPs are powerful tools for enforcing compliance but require planning
- Documenting errors and retry mechanisms is essential for enterprise rollout
